# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

This project contains two activities:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**  
   - Reads a file (`input.txt`)  
   - Modifies the content (converts to uppercase and adds line numbers)  
   - Writes the result to a new file (`output.txt`)  

2. **Error Handling Lab**  
   - Asks the user for a filename  
   - Tries to open and read the file  
   - If the file does not exist or cannot be read, it displays handled error messages
